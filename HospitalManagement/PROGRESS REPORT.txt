PROGRESS REPORT
We completed the DDL and the tables. We learn how to use github and created a repository. We start with the java program 
and we share it with the members of the team and they have imported it. 
Next week we want to continue with the pojos and create the user interface and menu because we are trying to
follow the schedule
