PROGRESS REPORT
This week we expected to be able to reach the point three of the project.
- Reasons why:
o We wanted to follow the programmed schedule
This week we reached point 3 but we completely changed our topic so we need to do some changes in every point.
Next week we will catch up with point 4 because we want to follow the programmed schedule.
