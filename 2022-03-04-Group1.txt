PROGRESS REPORT
This week we expected to be able to catch up to the schedule because we do not want to feel stressed about the project.
This week we finished the E-R diagram and the tables associated to the diagram (steps 1, 2 and 3).
Next week we need to pass the tables to SQL in DDL. Also we want to create the DDL  for our relational database because we want to move on.
